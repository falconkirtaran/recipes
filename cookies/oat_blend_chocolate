1 1/4 cups oat flour
1 cup flour
1/4 tsp salt (omit if butter is salted)
1/2 tsp baking powder
1/2 tsp baking soda
1/2 cup butter (unsalted) - one can add up to 1/4 cup more if runnier, thinner cookies are desired
1/2 cup white sugar
1/2 cup brown sugar
1 egg
2 tsp vanilla
1 cup chocolate chips

Choice:
- 1/3 cups nuts, optional (walnuts or pecans)
- 1tbsp flour

Optional:
1 1/2 tsp instant coffee


Instructions:
If you wish to brown the butter, do so, and allow it to cool somewhat.
Blend the oat and wheat flour, baking powder, and baking soda.  Sift.
In a separate bowl, blend the sugar, and then add the butter, vanilla, and coffee powder.  Stir together (this cools the butter) and then add the egg, chocolate chips, and nuts.
Cut the wet bowl into the dry, blending all the flour.  Minimize kneading; this avoids developing the gluten.
Form into balls on a pan.  Try to minimize exposed chocolate on the bottom, and excessive lumps of chocolate or nuts.
