Mushroom discussion:
300g will make a reasonable soup, but you could use up to about 1kg of mushrooms.  The more you add, the thicker the soup.
We like an even split of 350-400g each of chantrelles and baby bella, but anything goes.
Use the stems.  You should cube the stems finely (about 5-7mm cubes), but you can slice the tops into strips.
