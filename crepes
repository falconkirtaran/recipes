300g all purpose white flour
3tbsp white sugar
2tbsp peanut oil (or any oil)
300ml heavy cream (can use 600ml milk, less good)
500ml water
50ml dark rum (or any flavouring spirit)
2tsp vanilla extract 
3 eggs
50g butter

Mix flour, butter, oil.  Add eggs and combine.  Add sugar.  Mix in cream bit by bit, then the water by halves.  Add rum.  Immersion blender but try to avoid making butter by accident.

Pour to cover pan and swirl to even.  Cook until browned and flip.  Butter and season (Demerara sugar), and brown other side.  Fold in quarters.

Amplified procedures:
There are three tricks to this: heat management, batter consistency, and timing.

Heat management: the pan needs to be hot enough to cook the crepe without drying it out, and not so hot that the centre remains uncooked.  Adjusting often is necessary.

Batter consistency: the batter should be thin enough to pour freely, but working thin batter is harder and requires better cookware.  If a shelf forms when you spread the batter by tilting the pan, it is too thick.  If you cannot flip them without breaking them, it is too thin.

Timing: cook by stages.  Wait after pouring until the edges come up and brown and butter fry bubbles form in the top.  Flip and apply butter and toppings.  Let it brown on the other side, and then fold it over and serve.
