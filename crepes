300g all purpose white flour
3tbsp white sugar
2tbsp peanut oil (or any oil)
300ml heavy cream (can use 600ml milk, less good)
300ml water
50ml dark rum (or any flavouring spirit)
2tsp vanilla extract 
3 eggs
50g butter

Mix flour, butter, oil.  Add eggs and combine.  Add sugar.  Mix in cream bit by bit, then the water by halves.  Add rum.  Immersion blender but try to avoid making butter by accident.

Pour to cover pan and swirl to even.  Cook until browned and flip.  Butter and season (Demerara sugar), and brown other side.  Fold in quarters.
