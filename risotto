2 tbsp olive oil
1 shallot
6 cloves garlic

5 bay leaves
5 tbsp salted butter

1tbsp worchestershire sauce

Need:
Stockpot
Large pot
Small pan
Ladle

In a large pot, simmer the chicken broth, bay leaves, and worchestershire sauce
While doing this, mince the garlic and shallot and sweat them in the butter with the salt and pepper
While doing this, heat the olive oil in the stockpot, and fry the rice until brown
Once browned:
Add the contents of the allium pan to the rice (spatula all the butter into it) and combine
Add the mushrooms and cook them down as though for stroganoff, allowing the rice to take up the liquid
Deglaze with the red wine and add any remaining red wine.  Simmer until thick.
Add the broth in stages (initially about 1/2 cup), cooking the mixture down while stirring constantly
If the texture is too thick, add more broth.
Once the broth is all cooked down, stir in the cheese in stages
Mess forth.  It can be garnished with chopped parsley.
