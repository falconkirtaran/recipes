This is the temperature map for how much to reverse sear beef.
Preheat the oven to the lowest temperature you can stand to wait for (suggested 150-200F)
Put the beef in the oven with a meat thermometer in the thickest part.
Take it out when it's at the temperature, and then sear a crust onto it in a hot pan.
If the pan is not hot enough, you will overshoot the doneness.  If you don't have access to a hot pan, reduce the reverse sear temperatures by 10-15 degrees F.

105F Rare
115F Medium-Rare
125F Medium
135F Medium-Well
