Set a kettle heating to 75°C.
Heat about 30-40ml of heavy cream and 15ml of vanilla extract in a pan on medium heat.  Do not scald the cream.
Lower the heat, and add chocolate, about one handful per serving.
As the chocolate melts, whisk it into the cream.  Do not suffer the chocolate to cook onto the pan.
Once the melt is homogeneous, turn off the heat and add the water in stages, starting with 25ml, combining fully before the next stage
Once fluid, pour off into a serving vessel like a pyrex mixing bowl.
Further dilute to taste, washing the remaining chocolate from the pan.
Mess forth.  One can stir in cream, milk, sugar, or water, or top with whipped cream, or add amaretto.
