1/3 cup rice
1/2 cup sugar (1/3 if you want it only moderately sweet, add more but not less)
pinch salt
1 cups cream
3 cups water
flavouring (can be: saffron, cinnamon, vanilla, chestnut flour, cardamom, allspice, rum)
- Recommended minimum: 1 tbsp vanilla extract, 1 tsp cardamom, 1/4 tsp cinnamon
- Add up to 2tbsp rose water
Optional: Up to 1/4 cup cashews crumbled into quarters

300 degree oven, casserole pan

Stir, bake 30min (x3)

Check and stir every 10min until it's fluid and the rice is about as desired.

It will thicken as it cools, so keep this in mind and don't overcook it.
